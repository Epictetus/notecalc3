Notecalc is a handy calculator trying to bring the advantages of Soulver
to the web.

You can use it as a combination of a calculator and a notepad, mixing calculations,
numbers, operators, units of measurement with meaningful, descriptive texts around them,
providing context for your calculations. Results on the right are automatically
updated when text changes.

Text is automatically saved in your local browser, nothing is sent to the server.

You can grab and move the right gutter  (the grey separator line between this editor
and the results) with the mouse to resize the editor/result area.

Some examples. Feel free to change them and play around.


# Percentages
100 + 10%
200 * 5%
200 - 20%


# Numbers
You don't have to count zeros 100k
    or 10M
Space separated numbers 10 000 000

4e12
3.14e-2


# Binary and Hex
Binary and Hex numbers 0xFF
0b1100 + 0b0011
bit shifting 0b0001 << 4
16 XOR 255
NOT(255) AND 0xFFFF

The base of the result can be changed by pressing Left or Right cursor while
holding down Alt key. The '0x' and '0b' on the right gutter tells you in which base
the result appears.


# Referencing lines
You can reuse calculations by clicking them in the result panel,
  or selecting them with the UP/DOWN keys while holding ALT.

12 dollar bed * 3 beds
price is 3 people * &[48]

In the above line, 36 is a referenced value from line 38.
Change anything in line 38, and it will be reflected in the referencing value.
You can even move the referenced lines around.


# Variables
Bank of America = 50 000$/year + 5.25%
Citibank = 50 000$/year + 6%
Difference of Citibank - Bank of America
&[59] * 3years

## Autocompletion
Citi
Move the cursor at the end of the previous line and press TAB.
The variable name will be automatically completed.

There are some built in snippet that can be autocompleted, e.g.
.pi
.mat3
(press Tab while the cursor is at the end of the previous lines)

## Sum variable
12$ for beer
2*13$ for tickets
all spending = sum

sum always holds the sum of the previous calculations.
Headers reset reset its value to zero.
### This header sets sum to zero
0
sum is now zero


# Units
The road took 45minutes and the speed of the vehicle was * 12km/h
(This is an example that comments can be anywhere in an expressions.
The previous line works because it is basically a simple multiplication
between 45minutes and 12km/h, but there are words between the operands and
the operator, which, of course, are ignored when calculating the result)
Downloading a 1GB file with / 10Mb/s in min
or simply 1GB / 10Mb/s in min
12 km/h in m/s
5 m^2/s in km^2/h

# Matrix and Vector
[5,60,7,8] * [1,0,0,0;0,2,0,0;0,0,3,0;0,0,0,4]

# Comments
12 + 3 // the numbers and operatiors are ignored in comments: 12 * 3


# Huge and Small numbers
all possibilities = 99*98*97*96*95
The chance to winning the lottery is 1/all possibilities
If a ticket costs 300$
buying that much ticket would cost all possibilities * &[105]
If the prize of the lottery is 3.6e9$ (TODO 3.6 Mrd)
Then it is (&[106] / &[107]) times
more expensive to buy all the tickets than the reward itself.
